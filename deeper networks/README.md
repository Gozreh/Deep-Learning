# Deeper networks for image recognition.

Uses the GoogLeNet, ResNet, and VGG models to classify images from the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. Compares the accuracy of each model.

The MNIST dataset contains handwritten digits; the CIFAR-10 dataset contains images from 10 different categories (e.g. dog and automobile).

Project_funtions.py contains the functions needed to train the various models.
